# lhc_gcm_extension
An extension to enable FCM push notifications for livehelperchat android app.

**Current version: 0.1.3**  
**Change Log:**  
Added Support for twilio SMS  
Push notification bug fixes  

**It is recommended to use the latest version of main LHC web**

**To UPDATE**  
If you already have the extension installed,
1. Just replace the content of <LHC_install_dir>/extension/gcm with the content from 'gcm' directory you have downloaded.
2. Clear LHC cache from LHC settings page for update to reflect.
3. In the app, Go to "Server Details" in the menu Drawer and tap Re-Sync in the top bar.

**Installation**  

To Install Extension 
1. Download the extension and copy the 'gcm' directory to <LHC_install_dir>/extension
2. Activate the extension by adding 'gcm' to the 'extension' array in <LHC_install_dir>/settings/settings.ini.php 
[e.g look for  'settings' => array ('site' =>array ( 'extensions' =>array ( 0 =>'gcm'),]

Refer to this for example: https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/livehelperchat/blob/0f5127f58d0238888d6dc368662cfcd6fcc62c7e/lhc_web/settings/settings.ini.default.php#L25

Note: Path to extension directory should be '<LHC_install_dir>/extension/gcm' else it won't work.

**CONFIGURE APP**

3. Login/Password for app is same as the web logins
4. Server url is the address to your livehelperchat installation. Preferrably, use a subdomain.
    eg. http://livehelperchat.yourdomain.com or https://yourdomain.com/livehelperchat

5. If the registration is successful on your server, you will receive a notification in the notification bar of your phone telling you 'Device Successfully Registered'.  
6.  You will receive new push notifications for new chat request, new messages and unread messages.

If you do not receive a push notification after login, then try the next step.

7. In the app, open the menu drawer, select Server Details and Tap 'Sync Server'.

##  Important - REST API Requirements
The latest version of the Application requires the REST API that is included in LHC web to work. The username and password will not work with the REST API by default. Additional permissions have to be assigned to user before the app can work with the username and password.

**setting Permissions to use username and password for REST API**

To access REST API with username and password as user, the user has to be given the following permissions [lhrestapi], use_direct_logins.

1. In LHC web settings, go to System -> Users -> User -> Edit -> Permissions -> Show permissions
2. Click "[lhrestapi] Live helper Chat REST API service"
3. Check the two checkboxes beside [use_admin] and [use_direct_logins]
4. Click "Request permission" button. After that the app will be able to use the REST API.

## Troubleshooting Issues

The app and twilio extension now requires the REST API in LHC. However, the rest API might not work with the default .htaccess configuration.
Adding the configuration below to .htaccess file may work. 

```
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials true
Header always Set Access-Control-Allow-Methods: "GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE"
Header always Set Access-Control-Allow-Headers: "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, API-Key, Authorization" 


SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
```
